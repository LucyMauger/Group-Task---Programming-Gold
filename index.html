        <h2> What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <p> Climate change is a large scale issue having many visible effects on our society today. It describes a change in the average conditions, such as temperature and rainfall over a long period of time. Some examples include:
            <ul>
                <li> Pollution</li>
                <li> Rising sea levels</li>
                <li> Shrinking mountain glaciers</li>
                <li> More frequent and more intense drought</li>
            </ul>

        <h2> What causes Climate Change?</h2>
        <p> Many factors contribute to the climate of the Earth, but scientists agree that the Earth has been getting warmer in the past 50 to 100 years.
            A big part of this has been human activities:
            Examples of human activities include:
            <li> Burning fuel to power factories, cars and buses</li>
            <li> Cutting down forests</li>
            <li> Farming livestock</li>
        </p>

        <h2> What could the impacts of climate change be in the long-term?</h2>
        <p> 
        <ul>
            <li> Decrease in sea ice levels </li>
            <li> An increase in permafrost thawing</li>
            <li> Changes in precipitation patterns </li>
            <li> Continued rise in temperatures which are not uniform or smooth</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2> What can individuals do?</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Eating less meat and dairy</li>
            <li> Cut back on flying</li>
            <li> Don't use the car for short journeys</li>
            <li> Reduce energy use e.g. turning off lights when you don't need them</li>
        </ul> </p>
